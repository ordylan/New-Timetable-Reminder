#New Timetable Reminder
A great webpage timetable reminder that supports offline use(with Service Worker).  
I also wrote a class bell specifically for this, and you can check the music score at ``class.mid``.  
There is also a reminder for every 30 minutes of rest (this song is selected from Doraemon's birthday song).  
It also supports A2HS for easy opening.  

#新課表提醒
非常棒的一款支持離線的網頁課表提醒(使用Service Worker).  
我還特地為此寫了個上課鈴, 你可以在``class.mid``查看樂譜.  
也有每30分鐘的休息提醒(這首歌選自哆啦A夢的生日歌).  
它還支持添加到主荧幕, 便於開啟.
